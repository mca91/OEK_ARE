## Data Wrangling with `dplyr` and `tidyr`

1. Load the nycflights13::flights data set. Does it come formatted as a tibble?

    ```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(nycflights13)
data("flights")
class(flights)
    ```

2. Find all flights that
    - had an arrival delay of two or more hours.
    ```{r}
    filter(flights, arr_delay >= 120)
    ```
        
   -  Flew to Houston (IAH or HOU).
    ```{r}
     filter(flights, dest %in% c("IAH", "HOU"))
    ```
   - were delayed by at least an hour, but made up over 30 minutes in flight.
    ```{r}
    flights %>% filter(dep_delay > 60 & arr_delay <= dep_delay - 30)
    ```
   - departed between midnight and 6 am.
    ```{r}
     filter(flights , between(dep_time, 0, 600) | dep_time == 2400)
    ```
   
3. Which flights took the longest and which the shortest? 
    ```{r}
    slice(flights, which.max(air_time))
    slice(flights, which.min(air_time))
    filter(flights, air_time == max(air_time, na.rm = T))
    filter(flights, air_time == min(air_time, na.rm = T))
    ```

4. Brainstorm as many ways as possible to select `dep_time`, `dep_delay`, `arr_time`, and `arr_delay`.

    ```{r}
selection <- c("dep_time", "dep_delay", "arr_time", "arr_delay")
flights[ ,selection]
flights %>% select(selection)
    ```

5. Create a new variable `first_flight` which takes the value `TRUE` if it is the first flight of the day.
    ```{r}
flights <-  mutate(flights, first_flight = if_else(day - lag(day) != 0 | is.na(day - lag(day)), TRUE, FALSE )) 
filter(flights, first_flight == TRUE)

# A solution using group_by()
flights %>%
  group_by(year, month, day) %>%
  mutate(first_flight = if_else(row_number() == 1, TRUE, FALSE )) %>%
  select(first_flight)
    ```

6. Find out in which district the most incident where reported.
    ```{r}
crime <- as_tibble(read.csv(here::here("datasets", "BostonCrime.csv")))
crime %>% 
  group_by(DISTRICT) %>%
  summarise(N = n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(N))
    ```

7. Find out in which district the most incident where reported.
    ```{r}
crime %>% 
  filter(OFFENSE_CODE_GROUP == "Drug Violation") %>% 
  group_by(DISTRICT) %>% 
  summarise(N = n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(N)) 
    ```

8. What is the most dangerous hour of the week?
    ```{r}
crime %>% 
  filter(OFFENSE_CODE_GROUP == "Homicide") %>% 
  group_by(HOUR, DAY_OF_WEEK) %>%
  summarise(N = n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(N))
    ```

10. Calculate for each district the proportion of motor vehicle accidents to all reported incidents.
    ```{r}
crime %>% 
  group_by(DISTRICT) %>%  
  transmute(prop_accidents = sum(OFFENSE_CODE_GROUP == "Motor Vehicle Accident Response") / n()  )
    ```

11. Sort the data set chronologically by year and month. Then take the first 10.000 observations and compute the proportion of incidents where a shooting was involved for each district. Now take a random sample of size 10.000. Is there a noteworthy difference?
    ```{r}
set.seed(1245)

crime %>% 
  arrange(desc(YEAR), desc(MONTH)) %>%
  slice(1:10000) %>% 
  summarise(shooting = mean(SHOOTING == "Y"))

crime %>% 
  sample_n(10000) %>% 
  summarise(shooting = mean(SHOOTING == "Y"))
    ```

12. Compute the rate for `table2`, and `table4a` + `table4b`.
    ```{r}
# Using table 2. Adding the computed data to the table would be inconvenient.
table2[table2$type == "cases", "count"] / table2[table2$type == "population", "count"]
# Using table4a + `table4b
table4a[ ,-1] / table4b[ ,-1]
    ```


13. Recreate the plot given by the code below using `table2` instead of `table1`.
    ```{r}
## Using Table 1
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(table1, aes(year, cases)) + 
  geom_line(aes(group = country), colour = "grey50") + 
  geom_point(aes(colour = country))

## Using Table 2
ggplot(table2 %>% filter(type == "cases"), aes(x = year, y = count)) +
    geom_line(aes( group = country)) +
    geom_point(aes(color = country))
    ```
