### Names and Values

---
## Assignment Operators (?)

.smaller[

`<-` is often used for assignment but some people use `=` instead. There is, however, a subtle difference in how they are evaluated when mixed in the same expression. 

.blockquote.exercise[
#### `r icon::fa("desktop")` Example: operator *precedence*

.medium[

```{r, error=TRUE}
a <- b <- 1
a == b
a = b = 1
a == b
a = b <- 1
a == b
x <- b = 1
```

]]]

???

- This really is just a convention and nothing precludes using `=` instead of `<-` for assignment

- Fact: `<-` comes from a time where there actually was a `<-` key on keyboards.

---
## Assignment Operators (?)

.smaller[

- For consistency we use `<-` for binding and `=` for assigning function arguments.

- Note, however, that there are reasonable [proposals](http://www.win-vector.com/blog/2016/12/the-case-for-using-in-r/comment-page-1/) for using other conventions.

<br>
.content-box-white[
**Task:** 

Find out what `->` does and think of an application where it might be useful.

*Hint:* Experiment to find out about the precedence relation between `<-`, `->` and `=`.
]]

???

- `->` is the right-assignment operator

- The precedence relation is `->` >> `<-` >> `=` so `x <- 1 -> b` is another working alternative to the last line on the previous slide

---
## Assignment Operators (?)

.smaller[
Assignment operators work in the environment they are invoked in. The super assignment operator `<<-` assigns in the enclosing environment, provided the binding exists there.

.blockquote.exercise[
#### `r icon::fa("desktop")` Example: super assignment

```{r}
var_GE <- 1

a <- function(x) {
  b <- function(x) var_GE <<- x
  b(x)
}

a(3)
var_GE
```

]]

???

- If `<<-` does not find a corresponding binding in the enclosing environment, it looks in the parent environment and works it's way up towards to global environment (GE)

- If the binding does not exist in the GE, it will be created there

---
## Bindings

.smaller[

Knowing what assignment does internally is crucial for understanding performance and memory usage of your code and R's functional programming tools.

So what happens if we define a vector `x`? The idiom *'the object `x` stores the vector'* is not quite right... 

.blockquote.exercise[
#### `r icon::fa("desktop")` Example: binding a vector

**Binding** means that the name has a value: `x` is a **reference** to a value living in the computer's memory.

.pull-left[
  ![:image 40%](img/binding-1.png)
  <br>
  ![:image 40%](img/binding-2.png)
  ![:source 2019](Wickham)
]
.pull-right[
  ```{r}
  x <- c(1, 2, 3)
  ```
  <br>
  ```{r}
  y <- x
  ```
]]]

---
## Bindings &mdash; Character Vectors

A `character` vector is a binding to a vector of strings.

.blockquote.exercise[
#### `r icon::fa("desktop")` Example: binding a `character` vector

.smaller[

.pull-left[
  <br>
  ![:image 55%](img/character.png)
  ![:image 55%](img/character-2.png)
  ![:source 2019](Wickham)
]
.pull-right[
```{r}
x <- c("a", "a", "abc", "d")
obj_size(x)
obj_sizes("a", "a", "abc", "d")
```
]]]

---
## Copy-on-modify

.smaller[

R's copy-on-modify behavior is blessing and curse: we may use references without the risk of breaking existing code but modifying a reference may trigger a copy of the value.

.blockquote.exercise[
#### `r icon::fa("desktop")` Example: copy-on-modify

.pull-left[
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  ![:image 40%](img/binding-3.png)
  ![:source 2019](Wickham)
]
.pull-right[
.smaller[
```{r}
x <- c(1, 2, 3)
y <- x

y[[3]] <- 4
x
```

```{r}
obj_addr(x)
obj_addr(y)
```
]
]]]

???

- This is very different for many other languages, including c++ which we will see later during the course.

- Question: object addresses (like `0x7f9ef3059d38`) will be different (unpredictable) if the code is re-run. Why?

---
## Copy-on-modify

.smaller[

We may use `tracemem()` to obtain info when a copy of an object is generated.

.blockquote.exercise[
#### `r icon::fa("desktop")` Example: `tracemem()`

`tracemem()` returns the copied object, the new address (and the **call stack**, if functions are involved).

```r
x <- c(1, 2, 3)
tracemem(x)
```

`[1] "<0x7fba7740ebb8>"`

```r
y <- x
y[[3]] <- 4
```

`tracemem[0x7fba7740ebb8 -> 0x7fba76883958]:`

```r
y[[3]] <- 5
# stop tracking
untracemem(x)
```

]]

???

Simply put, a call stack describes the order of nested function calls.

---
## Copy-on-modify &mdash; Function Calls

.smaller[

The above rules apply to function calls as well.

.blockquote.exercise[
#### `r icon::fa("desktop")` Example: `tracemem()`

.pull-left[
  <br>
  <br>
  ![:image 70%](img/binding-f1.png)
  ![:source 2019](Wickham)
]
.pull-right[
```{r}
f <- function(a) a
x <- c(1, 2, 3)
tracemem(x)

z <- f(x) # no copy here!

untracemem(x)
```
]]]

???

No copy because `z` is just a reference to the value of `x`.

---
## Copy-on-modify &mdash; Function Calls

.smaller[

<br>
<br>

.content-box-white[
**Task:** 

Predict what `tracemem()` returns if the highlighted lines get executed, respectively.

```r
f <- function(a) {
  a[[1]] <- 0
  a
}

x <- c(1, 2, 3)
tracemem(x)

*f(x)

*z <- f(x)

untracemem(x)
```
]]

???

- **`f(x)`**: `f()` binds `a` to the same memory location `x` points to *during execution*. In Contrast to the previous slide, a copy is made since `f()` modifies `a`.

- **`z<-f(x)`**: as above. `z` is a binding the same location as `a` (no additional copy made).

---
## Copy-on-modify &mdash; Lists

.smaller[

Lists are special: list *elements are references* to values.

<br>
.content-box-white[
**Task:** 

Which code statement generates the result shown in each diagram? What is special about the bottom one?

.pull-left[
  ![:image 35%](img/list.png)
]
.pull-right[
  ![:image 35%](img/l-modify-1.png)
]
![:image 20%](img/l-modify-2.png)
![:source 2019](Wickham)
]]

???

```r
l1 <- list(1, 2, 3)    # left
l2 <- l1               # right
l2[[3]] <- 4           # bottom
```

Note that copy-on-modify due to `l2[[3]] <- 4 ` results in a **shallow** copy: the bindings are copied, not the values. => performance considerations!

---
## Copy-on-modify &mdash; Lists

<br>
.content-box-white[

You may check your predictions using `lobstr::ref()`.

```{r, echo=4}
l1 <- list(1, 2, 3)
l2 <- l1
l2[[3]] <- 4
ref(l1, l2)
```

]

---
## Copy-on-modify &mdash; Data frames

.smaller[

Data frames are list objects whose elements point to column vectors. 

.blockquote.exercise[
#### `r icon::fa("desktop")` Example: `data.frame()`

.pull-left[
![:image 40%](img/dataframe.png)
]
.pull-right[
```r
d1 <- data.frame(
  x = c(1, 5, 6), 
  y = c(2, 4, 3)
)
```
]]
<br>
.content-box-white[
**Task**: Explain why modifying a row of a data frame generally is more costly than changing a column.
]]

???

**A**: modifying a row implicates modifying *all* columns.

---
## Exercises

.smaller[

1. Why is `tracemem(1:10)` not useful?

2. Explain why `tracemem()` shows two copies when you run this code. *Hint:* carefully look at the difference between this code and the code on Slide 11.
    ```r
    x <- c(1L, 2L, 3L)
    tracemem(x)
    
    x[[3]] <- 4
    ```

3. Explain the below results.
    ```{r}
    obj_size(1:10)
    obj_size(1:1e6)
    ```

]

???

1. `1:10` is no binding so there's no point in asking for its value.

2. Here `x` is an integer vector (`x` has `double` type as defined on Slide 11). Replacing `3L` with `4`, i.e. integer with double, triggers coercion of `x` to `double`. This always results in a copy.

3. `:` is special in the sense that it generates integer sequences using only the first and the last element. The number of elements thus doesn't affect the required memory.

---
## Modify-in-place

.smaller[

R modifies in-place in two cases:

1. the object has **only one** binding

2. the object is an **environment**

.blockquote.exercise[
#### `r icon::fa("desktop")` Example: optimised modification

```r
v <- c(1, 2, 3)
obj_addr(v)
```

```
## [1] "0x7fcce1ca03d8"
```

```r
v[[2]] <- 4
# check that v still points to the same memory location
obj_addr(v)
```

```
## [1] "0x7fcce1ca03d8"
```

]]

---
## Case Study: Copy-On-Modify Inferno

.smaller[

- Whether or not R copies an object &mdash; and if so, how many times &mdash; is often very hard to predict.

- You should **never** modify a data frame in a loop.

```{r, eval=F}
x <- data.frame(
  matrix(runif(5 * 1e4), 
         ncol = 5)
  )

medians <- vapply(x, median, numeric(1))

tracemem(x)

for (i in seq_along(medians)) {
  x[[i]] <- x[[i]] - medians[[i]]
}
```

]

???

We will come back to this issue in the Chapter *Improving Performance* and benchmark against alternatives that require less copies.

---
## Case Study: Copy-On-Modify Inferno

`[[<-.data.frame` is revealed to be quite expensive.

```r
tracemem[0x7fe1aed76628 -> 0x7fe1ad4dc428]: 
tracemem[0x7fe1ad4dc428 -> 0x7fe1ad4dc578]: [[<-.data.frame [[<- 
tracemem[0x7fe1ad4dc578 -> 0x7fe1ad4dc658]: [[<-.data.frame [[<- 
tracemem[0x7fe1ad4dc658 -> 0x7fe1ad4dc7a8]: 
tracemem[0x7fe1ad4dc7a8 -> 0x7fe1ad4dc8f8]: [[<-.data.frame [[<- 
tracemem[0x7fe1ad4dc8f8 -> 0x7fe1ad4dcb98]: [[<-.data.frame [[<-

tracemem[0x7fe1ad4dd068 -> 0x7fe1ad4dd308]: [[<-.data.frame [[<- 
tracemem[0x7fe1ad4dd308 -> 0x7fe1ad4dd4c8]: 
tracemem[0x7fe1ad4dd4c8 -> 0x7fe1ad4dd618]: [[<-.data.frame [[<- 
tracemem[0x7fe1ad4dd618 -> 0x7fe1ad4ddae8]: [[<-.data.frame [[<- 
tracemem[0x7fe1ad4ddae8 -> 0x7fe1acdbda28]: 
tracemem[0x7fe1acdbda28 -> 0x7fe1acdbe198]: [[<-.data.frame [[<- 
tracemem[0x7fe1acdbe198 -> 0x7fe1acdbe6d8]: [[<-.data.frame [[<- 
```

---
## Case Study: Copy-On-Modify Inferno

What's happening here and why?

- `x` is referenced more than once: 

      - global environment 
      - inside of `[[` 
      - inside of `[[<-.data.frame()` 
    
    &rarr; modifying `x` will result in a copy

- The following runs inside `[[`:
    ```r
    `*tmp*` <- df
    df <- `[[<-.data.frame`(`*tmp*`, <additional arguments>)
    rm(`*tmp*`)
    ```
    
    - The additional binding to `*tmp*` results in a copy
    
    - `[[<-.data.frame` changes the class and a component of `x` (two additional copies)

???

- The two copies made by `[[<-.data.frame` are **shallow copies** (only column references are copied)

- **Q to students**: What kind of function is `[[<-.data.frame`?

    **A**: A regular function. It is a method of  `[[<-` which is a primitive (a fast C function)

- **Q to students**: How can you view the source? 

    **A**: <code>\`[[<-.data.frame\`</code>

- More on primitives on the next slides. More on methods, dispatch etc. in the 'OOP' Chapter.

- More on how to write efficient code (and especially efficient `for()` loops) in Chapter 'Improving Performance'

## Case Study: Copy-On-Modify Inferno

.smaller[

It's better to use a list.

```{r, eval=F}
y <- as.list(x)
tracemem(y)

for (i in 1:5) {
  y[[i]] <- y[[i]] - medians[[i]]
}
```

```r
tracemem[0x7fba72971928 -> 0x7fba72a2e178]:
```

.pull-left[
*Before loop:*
```
█ [1:0x7fba72971928] <named list> 
├─X1 = [2:0x10f1ec000] <dbl> 
├─X2 = [3:0x115c56000] <dbl> 
├─X3 = [4:0x115c6a000] <dbl> 
├─X4 = [5:0x115c7e000] <dbl> 
└─X5 = [6:0x115c92000] <dbl> 
```
]
.pull-right[
*After loop:*
```
█ [1:0x7fba72a2e178] <named list> 
├─X1 = [2:0x115cc7000] <dbl> 
├─X2 = [3:0x115ca6000] <dbl> 
├─X3 = [4:0x10f07e000] <dbl> 
├─X4 = [5:0x10ef83000] <dbl> 
└─X5 = [6:0x10f056000] <dbl> 
```
]]

???

- A single copy is made since the loop modifies (existing) list entries

- This a good example where tweaking the code reduces the amount of copies made

- If such a solution is not readily at hand we may resort to C++ code. More on this in the `Rcpp` chapter.

---
## Modifying Lists

.smaller[

What happens if we modify list entries is better understood using the following example.

.blockquote.exercise[
#### `r icon::fa("desktop")` Example: modifying a list

Can you explain what's going on?

.pull-left[
```{r, eval=F}
# Step 1
x <- list(1:10)
lobstr::ref(x)

# Step 2
x[[2]] <- x
lobstr::ref(x)

# Step 3
x[[1]] <- 11:20
lobstr::ref(x)
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r, echo=F}
# Step 1
x <- list(1:10)
lobstr::ref(x)

# Step 2
x[[2]] <- x
lobstr::ref(x)

# Step 3
x[[1]] <- 11:20
lobstr::ref(x)
```
]]]

---
## Garbage Collection

.smaller[

Everyday operations that are reflected in the RStudio's 'Environment' tab are unbinding and deletion. What does actually happen if we alter a name or even 'remove' the object from the (global) environment?

.blockquote.exercise[
#### `r icon::fa("desktop")` Example: unbinding an object

.row[
.pull-left[
**(a) binding**
  ![:image 32%](../img/unbinding-1.png)
]

.pull-right[
```{r}
x <- 1:3
```
]]

.row[
.pull-left[
**(b) implicit unbinding**
  ![:image 32%](../img/unbinding-2.png)
]

.pull-right[
```{r}
x <- 2:4
```
]]

.row[
.pull-left[
**(c) explicit unbinding**
  ![:image 32%](../img/unbinding-3.png)
]

.pull-right[
```{r}
rm(x)
```
]]]]

---
## Garbage Collection &mdash; Quick Facts

.smaller[

- R uses a tracing **Garbage Collector** (GC): it keeps track of objects in the global environment and references therein.

- The GC runs automatically if space is needed for creating new objects. There is *no need to actively force garbage collection*. You can, however, do so by calling `gc()` with the side effect of info on memory occupation.

- You may run `gcinfo(TRUE)` if you wish to be informed when the GC runs

.blockquote.exercise[
#### `r icon::fa("desktop")` Example: garbage collection

```{r, cache = T}
gc()          # just for the side effect
mem_used()    # total, but more exact
```
]]

???

- The only reason to call `gc()` is if you need to free-up memory for your operating system &mdash; which will hardly ever happen.

- vcells = memory used by vectors; ncells = memory used by anything else

- The large numbers report cells used (8 byte each)

- `lobstr::mem_used()` does not agree with what's reported by you OS: there are other objects (generated by, e.g., the R interpreter) which are not captured.

### Functions

---
## Functions

<blockquote style ="margin-top:15%;">
To understand computations in R, two slogans are helpful:<br><br>
Everything that exists is an object.
Everything that happens is a function call.
.right[&mdash; <cite>John Chambers</cite>]
</blockquote>

---
## Regular Functions vs. Primitives

.smaller[

- **Regular functions** live in environments and consists of a body along with formals

- **Primitives** are special `base` R functions that call C code

.blockquote.exercise[
#### `r icon::fa("desktop")` Example: primitives vs. regular functions

.medium[
.pull-left[
```{r}
typeof(lm)
environment(lm)
names(formals(lm))[1:4]
# body(lm)
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r}
typeof(sum)
environment(sum)
names(formals(sum))
body(sum)
```
]]]]

---
## First-Class Functions

.smaller[

R functions are **objects**. We may do stuff that seems quite exotic when compared to much more 'restrictive' languages like C and Python.

.blockquote.exercise[
#### `r icon::fa("desktop")` Example: fun with anonymous functions

.pull-left[
```{r}
funs <- list(
  function(x) x^2,
  function(x) x^3
)
lobstr::ref(funs)

sapply(funs, function(z) z(5))
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r}
(function(x) x^2)(5)
(function(x) x^3)(5)
```
]]]

???

Obviously, R functions are objects on their own right &mdash; they need not be bound to a name!

---
## First-Class Functions

.smaller[

<br>
<br>
.content-box-white[
**Task:** 

Explore what kind of function `(` is, what it does and explain why the statements
```r
(function(x) x^2)(5)
```
and

```{r}
(x<-5)
```

make sense.

]]

???

- `(` is a primitive:
    ```{r}
    `(`
    ```

-  The R-help hints that `(` is semantically equivalent to `function(x) x`. 

    E.g., `(x<-5)` is valid (and useful) R code!

---
## Lexical Scoping

.smaller[

**Scoping** refers to the routine of finding the value associated with a name. R's scoping mechanism follows four concepts you should already be familiar with. We summarise them briefly here.

1. **Name Masking**: 

    names defined inside a function mask names defined outside of it.

2. **Functions before variables**: 

    functions and objects in *different* environments may share the same name. R ignores non-function objects in function calls. 

3. **Execution Environments**:

    functions generate ephemeral environments.
    
4. **Dynamic Look-up**: 

    R searches for values when the function is run (and not when it's created).

.content-box-white[
**Task:** 
Write a code snippet which is useful for demonstrating all of the above concepts.
]]

???

```{r}
rm(x)
z <- function(x) x^2

# 3. everything in f() happens in an ephemeral environment
f <- function(g) {       
    if(!exists("x")) {   
        x <- 1
    } else {
        x <- x + 1
    }
    z <- 2               # 1. name masking
    
    z(x + y)             # 2. functions before variables
}

y <- 20
f(x)                     # 4. dynamic lookup
```

---
## Lazy Evaluation &mdash; Promises

.smaller[

- A **Promise** consists of an expression along with an environment and a value which is computed an cached the first time the promise is accessed

- We implicitly use them when writing functions as they use **lazy evaluation**. Here we refer to **unevaluated arguments** as promises.  

- Lazy evaluation allows R functions to behave quite differently than, e.g., C functions and it is important to understand what's special about that. 

.blockquote.exercise[
#### `r icon::fa("desktop")` Example: outside evaluation

```{r}
f1 <- function(x) { y <- 5; x + 1 }
f1(y <- 6)
y
```

]]

???

- Loading a data set using `data()` uses a promise. See, e.g., `data(AirPassengers)`.

- The style shown in the example used by many base R function but it's not recommended since it's hard to understand what's going on.

---
## Lazy Evaluation

.smaller[
.blockquote.exercise[
#### `r icon::fa("desktop")` Example: laziness

```{r, message=T}
double <- function(x) { 
  message("Calculating...")
  x * 2
}

clone <- function(x) {
  c(x, x)
}

clone(double(20))
```

]]

???

We see that `double(20)` is evaluated only once when `c()` inside of `clone()` looks for `x` for the first time.

---
## Lazy Evaluation

.smaller[

.blockquote.exercise[
#### `r icon::fa("desktop")` Example: lazy evaluation of (default) function arguments

```{r}
f <- function(x) {
  cat("f: 'x doesn't matter to me.'")
}
f(x = stop("I don't matter."))
```

```{r}
# (default arguments)
f <- function(x = 1, y = x * 2, z = a + b) {
  a <- 10
  b <- 100
  c(x, y, z)
}
f()
```

]]

???

- Although we do not recommend this style, it reflects great flexibility due to lazy evaluation

- Note that this is very useful when a default argument is computationally expensive to evaluate and not needed in every call to `f()`

```{r, echo=-1}
rm(list = ls())
f <- function(x = ls()) {
  a <- 1
  x
}
f()
f(ls())
```

]]

???

- The evaluation environment for *default arguments* is the function environment whereas user supplied arguments are evaluated in the parent (i.e. the global) environment.

---
## Lazy Evaluation

Lazy evaluation also applies to other situations, e.g., in control flow.

```{r}
x <- NULL
if (!is.null(x) && x > 0) {
 # do something
}
```

**Task:** 

1. Which part of the code seems problematic at first sight? 

2. Give an explanation why the statement above does not produce an error.
]

???

1. Without lazy evaluation this statement would throw an error because `x > 0` evaluates to a logical value of length zero (you cannot compare `NULL` to `double`)

2. The second statement would be evaluated only if the first is true (but is is false)

## Exercises

.smaller[

1. Explain why the following does not work. Can you come up with a work-around without changing the definition of `f()`?
    ```{r, error=T}
    f <- function(x, z) {
      z + x^2
    }
    f(x = z^2, z = 2)
    ```

2. Explain what the `...` argument does by means of the following example:
    ```{r}
    f <- function(...) {
      names(list(...))
    }
    f(a = 1, b = 2)
    ```

]

???

1. Lazy evaluation applies only at function definition, not invocation: R looks for `z` in the global environment because `x` is not `z^2` by default, like below.
    ```{r, eval = F}
    f <- function(x = z^2, z) {
      z + x^2
    }
    f(2, 2)
    ```
    Workaround: `with(list(z = 2), f(x = z^2, z))`

2. `...` enables us to pass arguments (to other functions) which do not have to be prespecified.

## Function Forms

- Not all function calls look the same:

    - **prefix**: `f(a, b)`

    - **infix**: `a + b`. Also `==`, `<-`, `::`, ...

    - **replacement**: `names(c) <- c("x", "y")`

    - **special**: `for`, `[[`, `if`, ...

- Every function call can be written in prefix form!
    ```{r}
    `[`(1:3, 3)
    ```

???

@ infix: user defined operators (which begin and end with `%`)

#### `r icon::fa("desktop")` Example: rewrite special and infix as prefix

```{r}
1 + 2
`+`(1, 2)

x <- `:`(1, 10); x

`(`(x)

## Function Forms &mdash; User defined infix

It's straightforward to write your own operators in infix form.

.blockquote.exercise[
#### `r icon::fa("desktop")` Example: `paste0` as infix

```{r}
`%+%` <- function(a, b) paste0(a, b)
"new " %+% "string"
````

]

## Function Forms &mdash; Replacement Functions

Replacement functions have the form shown below.

```r
`name<-` <- function(x, value) {
  <...>
  x
} 
```

.blockquote.exercise[
#### `r icon::fa("desktop")` Example: replacement of last vector element

```{r}
`last<-` <- function(x, value) {
  x[length(x)] <- value
  x
}

x <- c(1, 2, 3)
last(x) <- 99; x
```

]

???

- Note that replacement functions **must** have `x` and `value` as arguments and return the modified object `x`

- Additional arguments may be passed between `x` and `value`


- `tracemem()` reports two copies. This is because `x` is copied inside of `last<-` and R runs
    ```r
    x <- `last<-`(x, 420)
    ```
    under the hood.

---
## Function Forms &mdash; Replacement Functions

Replacement functions are handy but there is no free lunch: they *always* trigger a copy.

.blockquote.exercise[
#### `r icon::fa("desktop")` Example: replacement of last vector element &mdash; ctd.

```{r, eval = c(1,3)}
tracemem(x)
last(x) <- 420
```

```
tracemem[0x7feac1eb7598 -> 0x7feaa7ce3908]: 
tracemem[0x7feaa7ce3908 -> 0x7feaa7ce68c8]: last<- 
```

```{r}
x
```
