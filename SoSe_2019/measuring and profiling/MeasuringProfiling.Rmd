### Profiling

---
## Prerequisites

```{r, echo=T, eval=F}
# packages needed
library(profvis)
library(bench)
```

- **Profiling** means measuring run time of our code *line-by-line* using realistic inputs in order to identify *bottlenecks*.

- After identifying bottlenecks we experiment with equivalent alternatives of code and find the fastest using a **microbenchmark**.

- We will use the packages `profvis` and `bench` for profiling and benchmarking.

It’s tempting to think you just know where the bottlenecks in your code are. I mean, after all, you write it! But trust me, I can’t tell you how many times I’ve been surprised at where exactly my code is spending all its time. The reality is that profiling is better than guessing.

## Profiling &mdash; `utils::Rprof()`

.smaller[

- `Rprof()` is a build-in *sampling profiler*. It keeps track of the *function call stack* at regularly sampled intervals.

- Note: results are *stochastic* &mdash; we never run a function under the same conditions twice (memory usage, CPU load etc.) 

.blockquote.exercise[
#### `r icon::fa("desktop")` Example: profiling a call of `replicate()`
```{r, eval = F, cache=TRUE}
tmp <- tempfile()

Rprof(tmp, interval = 0.1)       # start the profiler
replicate(5, mean(rnorm(1e6)))
Rprof(NULL)                      # stop profiling

writeLines(readLines(tmp))
```
```{r, echo=FALSE}
cat('
sample.interval=100000
"rnorm" "mean" "FUN" "lapply" "sapply" "replicate" 
"rnorm" "mean" "FUN" "lapply" "sapply" "replicate" 
"rnorm" "mean" "FUN" "lapply" "sapply" "replicate"

  pause(0.1)
  g()
  h()
}

g <- function() {
  pause(0.1)
  h()
}

## Profiling &mdash; some notes and hints

- C/C++ (or other compiled) code cannot be profiled

- We also cannot profile what happens *inside* primitive functions, e.g., `sum()` and `sqrt()` (these functions are written in C or FORTRAN).

  We thus cannot use profiling to see whether the code is slow due because something further down the call stack is slow.
  
- Profiling is just another reason to **break your code into functions** so that the profiler can give useful information about where time is being spent

### Microbenchmarking

---
## What is a Microbenchmark?

<br>
<br>

*A microbenchmark is a program designed to test a very small snippets of code for a specific task. Microbenchmarks are always artificial and they are not intended to represent normal use.*

- We usually speak of milliseconds (ms), microseconds (µs), or nanoseconds (ns) here. 

- **Important**: 

    microbenchmarks can rarely be generalised to 'real' code: the observed differences in microbenchmarks will typically be dominated by **higher-order effects** in real code.

  Think of it this way:
  
  A deep understanding of quantum physics is not very helpful when baking cookies.
  
- There are several R packages for microbenchmarking. We will rely on the `bench` package by Hester (2019) which has the most accurate timer function currently available in R.

---
## Microbenchmarking &mdash; the `bench` package

- `bench` is part of the `tidyerse`. It uses the highest precision APIs available for the common operating system (often nanoseconds-level!)

- `mark()` is the working horse of the `bench` package and measures both memory allocation and computation time.

- By default, a human-readable statistical summary on the distributions of memory load and timings based on 1e4 iterations is returned which also reports on garbage collections

- Benchmarking across a grid of input values with `bench::press()` is possible

- The package also has methods for neat visualization of the results using `ggplot2::autoplot()` (default plot type is [beeswarm](https://flowingdata.com/2016/09/08/beeswarm-plot-in-r-to-show-distributions/)) 

---
## Microbenchmarking &mdash; `bench::mark()`

.blockquote.exercise[
#### `r icon::fa("desktop")` Example: "the fastest square root"

```{r, eval=T}
x <- runif(100)

(lb <- bench::mark(
  sqrt(x),
  x^0.5
))
```

```{r, eval=F, warning=F, message=F}
plot(lb)
```
]

#### `r icon::fa("desktop")` Example: "the fastest square root"

```{r, echo=F, fig.width=14, fig.height=5.5, fig.align='center'}
plot(lb)
```

]

---
## Microbenchmarking &mdash; `bench::mark()`

.smaller[
.blockquote.exercise[
#### `r icon::fa("desktop")` Example: non-equivalent code

```{r, eval=F}
set.seed(42)

dat <- data.frame(
  x = runif(10000, 1, 1000),
  y = runif(10000, 1, 1000)
  )

bench::mark(
  dat[dat$x > 500, ],
  dat[which(dat$x > 499), ],
  subset(dat, x > 500)
  )
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
cat('
Error: Each result must equal the first result:
  `dat$x > 500` does not equal `which(dat$x > 499)` Each result must 
  equal the first result:
  `` does not equal ``
    ')
```

Use `check = FALSE` to disable checking of consistent results.

]]

---
## Microbenchmarking &mdash; `bench::press()`

Sometimes it is useful to benchmark against a grid of parameters. This can be done using `bench::press()`.

.smaller[
.blockquote.exercise[
#### `r icon::fa("desktop")` **Exercise: benchmark against parameter grid**

Benchmark `create_df()` for combination of `rows = c(10000, 100000)` and `cols = c(10, 100)`.

```{r, eval=F}
create_df <- function(rows, cols) {
  as.data.frame(matrix(
      unlist(replicate(cols, runif(rows, 1, 1000), simplify = FALSE)),
      nrow = rows, ncol = cols))
}
```

]]

---
## Microbenchmarking &mdash; Exercises

1. Instead of using `bench::mark()`, you could use the built-in function `system.time()` which is, however, much less precise, so you’ll need to repeat each operation many times with a loop, and then divide to find the average time of each operation, as in the code below.
    ```{r, eval=F}
    x <- runif(100)
    n <- 1e6
    system.time(for (i in 1:n) sqrt(x)) / n
    system.time(for (i in 1:n) x ^ 0.5) / n
    ```

  How do the estimates from `system.time()` compare to those from `bench::mark()`? Why are they different?

2. Here are two other ways to compute the square root of a vector. Which do you think will be fastest? Use microbenchmarking to test your answers.
    ```{r, eval=F}
    x^(1/2)
    exp(log(x)/2)
    ```

### (Why) is R slow?

---
## (Why) is R slow?

Think of R as both the definition of a language and its implementation.

**`R` language**

- The R language defines meaning of code statements and how they work (*very abstract*) 

- R is an extremely dynamic language, i.e., you have *a lot* freedom in modifying objects after they have been created

- This dynamism is comfortable because is allows you to iterate your code and alter objects &mdash; there's no need to start from scratch when something doesn't work out!

`r emo::ji('lightning')` Changes for improving speed without breaking existing code are problematic. 

---
## (Why) is R slow? &mdash; Slow Code Interpretation

But:

`R` is an interpreted language. Its dynamism causes code interpretation to be relatively time consuming.

.smaller[
.blockquote.exercise[
#### `r icon::fa("desktop")` Example: extreme dynamism

```{r, echo=TRUE, rx =T}
x <- 0L
for (i in 1:1e6) {
  x <- x + 1
}
```

]]

---
## (Why) is R slow?

**Implementation**

- Processes R code and computes results; commonly base R (*GNU-R*) from [cran.r-project.org](https://cran.r-project.org/src/base/R-3/)

- R (written in *FORTRAN*, *R*, and *C*) is more than 20 years old was not intended for super fast computations

- `r emo::ji('bolt')` tweaking for speed improvements is easier (done by R-core team) but not feasible for end users like us. <br><br> Some alternatives address specific issues:

  - "pretty quick R" [pqR](http://www.pqr-project.org/) (parallelisation of core functions)
  
  - [Microsoft R Open](https://mran.microsoft.com/open) (some fast extensions for machine learning)


---
## (Why) is R slow? &mdash; Name Look-up with Mutable Environments

**Remember Lexical Scoping:**

*"Values of variables are searched for in the environment the function belongs to."*

- If a value is not found in the environment in which a function was defined, search steps-up to the *parent environment*

- This continues down the sequence of parent environments until the top-level environment (usually the *global environment* or a package namespace) is reached

- After the top-level environment, the search continues down the *search list* until we hit the *empty environment*.

---
## (Why) is R slow? &mdash; Name Look-up with Mutable Environments

.smaller[
.blockquote.exercise[
#### `r icon::fa("desktop")` Example: have you seen z?

The interpreter asks: which environment does the value of `z` come from?

```{r, eval=FALSE}
f <- function(x, y) {
  x + y / z
}
```

```{r}
# print search list
search()
```

]]

Interpreter asks: which environment does the value of `z` come from?

```{r, eval=FALSE}
z <- 1                 # global environment

f <- function() {      # f() is parent to g()
  print(z)
  g <- function() {
    z <- 3
    print(z)
  }
  z <- 2
  print(z)
  g() 
}
f()
```

Name look-up is done every time we call `print(z)`!

]]

## (Why) is R slow? &mdash; Look-up with Mutable Environments

.smaller[

Even more problematic: most operations are lexically scoped function calls. This includes `+` and `-` but also (sometimes "recklessly" used) *operators* like `(` and `{`.

.blockquote.exercise[
#### `r icon::fa("desktop")` Example: excessive usage of parenthesis

(or: a good example of poorly written code)

```{r, cache=T}
g <- function(x) x = (1/(1 + x))
h <- function(x) x = ((1/(1 + x)))
i <- function(x) x = (((1/(1 + x))))

x <- sample(1:100, 100, replace = TRUE)

bench::mark(g(x), h(x), i(x))
```

]]

## (Why) is R slow? &mdash; Look-up with Mutable Environments

f <- function(x, y) {
  (x + y) ^ 2
}

random_env <- function(parent = globalenv()) {
  letter_list <- setNames(as.list(runif(26)), LETTERS)
  list2env(letter_list, envir = new.env(parent = parent))
}

set_env <- function(f, e) {
  environment(f) <- e
  f
}

f2 <- set_env(f, random_env())
f3 <- set_env(f, random_env(environment(f2)))
f4 <- set_env(f, random_env(environment(f3)))
```

]]

```{r, warning=F, message=F, cache=T}
bench::mark(f(1, 2), f2(1, 2), f3(1, 2), f4(1, 2))
```

Each additional environment between `f()` and the global environment where `+` and `^` are defined increases computation time.

## (Why) is R slow? &mdash; Lazy Evaluation Overhead

Remember that function arguments are lazy &mdash; they are only evaluated when actually needed. 

.blockquote.exercise[
#### `r icon::fa("desktop")` Example: lazy evaluation

```{r, eval=F}
f1 <- function(a) {
  force(a) # why not simply write 'a'?
  NULL
  }

f1(stop("My dog speaks Chinese"))
```

vs.

```{r, eval=F}
f1 <- function(a) NULL

f1(stop("My dog speaks Chinese"))
```

]

---
## (Why) is R slow? &mdash; Lazy Evaluation Overhead

Promises are very convenient but should be avoided if speed is crucial.

.blockquote.exercise[
#### `r icon::fa("desktop")` Example: lazy evaluation &mdash; ctd.

```{r}
f1 <- function(a) NULL
f2 <- function(a = 1, b = 2, c = 4, d = 4, e = 5) NULL
bench::mark(f1(), f2())
```

Arguments trigger promises each time the function is *called*. Superfluous arguments thus lead to avoidable overhead.

]

---
## (Why) is R slow? &mdash; Summary

- R is not slow *per se* &mdash; but it is slow compared to other languages:

    Speed isn't its strongest suit but accessability and compatibility are. R was designed to make life easier for you, not for your computer!

    More technically: R is an easy-to-use high level programming language. It provides a flexible and extensible toolkit for data analysis and statistics.

- We are (mostly) happy to accept the slower speed for the time saved from not having to reinvent the wheel each time we want to implement a new function that, e.g., computes a test statistic.

    (meanwhile there are `r nrow(available.packages(repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org"))` packages available on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) with many useful functions waiting to be discovered by you!)

- We cannot overcome the circumstances described in this section. However, there are a few things to keep in mind when you want to write high performance code. We'll discuss these in the next chapter.
