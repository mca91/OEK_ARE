**What is a functional programming language?**

- Simply put: a language which is centered on problem solving using functions!

- There are two common threads:

    1. A functional language has **first-class functions** which behave like any other data type. In R this means we may treat function like variables (i.e. assign them, store them in a list or pass them as arguments to other functions)
    
    2. Many functional languages require **pure** functions only. These are functions which have no side-effects: they do not interfere with anything outside their scope and produce output which depends only on the input.

???

1. R has first-class functions.

2. Does R allow for pure functions only? No: e.g. `print()` has side-effects. Obviously all functions which return pseudo-random numbers are not pure functions.
---
## FAQs
    
**Is R a functional programming language?**

- R is not a functional programming language but we may adopt a *functional style* of programming.

- **Functionals** are functions which take functions as input and produce, e.g. vector output

**Why should I use functional style programming?**

- Functional programming is often space efficient, very comprehensible and easily adopted to new situations

- Functionals are easily analysed in isolation and thus are often straightforward to optimize and parallelise

    (We'll discuss functionals in a minute)

???
You've probably used functionals already: `lapply()` and `integrate()` are prominent examples.

## FAQs

**What does 'functional programming style' even mean?**

It’s hard to describe exactly what a functional style is, but generally we will refer to the following definition:  

<br>
<blockquote>
Functional programming style means decomposing a big problem into smaller pieces, then solving each piece with a function or combination of functions.
.right[&mdash; <cite>Hadley Wickham</cite>]
</blockquote>

## FAQs

We will briefly discuss key techniques in functional R programming which are best summarized be the table below. We will focus on `purrr` functionals and applications of function factories.

## Functionals

A **functional** takes a function as an input and returns a vector as output.

```{r}
randomise <- function(f) f(rnorm(1e3))
randomise(mean)
randomise(sum)
```

???

Functionals can also produce other data structures, e.g., data frames as output.

---
## Functionals

.smaller[

- Functionals are often used as alternatives to loops. Not because loops are inherently slow (which is common wisdom), but because loops 

    - make it relatively cumbersome to harness the power of iteration

    - are prone to typos that are difficult to identify

    - can be *overly flexible*: loops convey that an iteration is done, but not what should be done with the results.
    
- Functionals are tailored to specific tasks which immediately convey *why* they are being used and what output format they produce.
    
- Switching from loops to functionals doesn't necessarily mean that we must write our own functionals: the `purrr` package provides functionals which are very concise and also fast as they are written in C.

]

???

- With functionals we don't need to worry about indexing, brackets, curly braces etc. 

- Of course, flexibility isn't bad. They idea of a functional programming is to use functionals that perform a specific iteration which returns a specific output format.

- Others are likely to be puzzled by looking at your code if it uses a lot of loops. Functionals immediately convey which iteration is done and which output is returned.

    'Others' also includes your future self :-)

Obviously `map()` returns a list.

## `purrr::map_*()` &mdash; Producing Atomic Vectors

.smaller[

- There are helper functions which are more convenient if simpler data structures are required: `map_lgl()`, `map_int()`, `map_dbl()`, and `map_chr()` return an atomic vector of the specified type

- Base R equivalents are `sapply()` and `vapply()`

n_unique <- function(x) length(unique(x))
map_int(mtcars, n_unique)
```
]]]]

???

- Remember that `logical`, `integer`, `double` and `character` are atomic types

- `mtcars` is a data frame thus the `map_*()` functions map the columns

- Of course, the `*` in `map_*()` must match the return type of the functions used for mapping

---
## `purrr::map_*()` &mdash; Producing Atomic Vectors

.smaller[

- The *twiddle operator* `~` allows to use anonymous functions in a less verbose manner. It conveys that the subsequent expression is a formula.

- A good rule of thumb is that if a function spans lines or uses `{...}`, we should give it a name.

.blockquote.exercise[
#### `r desktop` Example: `map_*()` with inline anonymous function

```{r}
map_dbl(mtcars, function(x) length(unique(x)))

```{r}
map_dbl(mtcars, ~ length(unique(.x)))
```

## `purrr::map_*()` &mdash; Producing Atomic Vectors

.smaller[

The `map_*()` functions are  useful for selecting elements from lists by name, position or both.

.blockquote.exercise[
#### `r desktop` Example: element extraction with `map_*()`

```{r}
x <- list(
  list(-1, x = 1, y = c(2), z = "a"),
  list(-2, x = 4, y = c(5, 6), z = "b"),
  list(-3, x = 8, y = c(9, 10, 11))
)
```

```{r}
map_dbl(x, "x")   # select by name
map_dbl(x, 1)     # select by position
```
]]

???

In base R we'd have to write a function that iterates through `x` or use `sapply()`.

Note that components must exist in all lists. 

```{r, error=TRUE}
map_chr(x, "z")   # z doesn't exist in x[[3]]
```

To prevent this error a `.default` value can be supplied.

```{r}
map_chr(x, "z", .default = NA)
```

Keep in mind that this requires your subsequent code to work with `NA`s.

Arguments passed to an anonymous function are evaluated in every iteration. The latter approach is more efficient because additional arguments are evaluated just once.

## `purrr::map_*()` &mdash; Exercises

1. `map(1:3, ~ runif(2))` is a useful pattern for generating random numbers, but `map(1:3, runif(2))` is not. Why not? Can you explain why it returns the result that it does?

2. The following code simulates the performance of a t-test for non-normal data. Extract the p-value from each test, then visualise.
    ```{r, eval=F}
    trials <- map(1:100, ~ t.test(rpois(10, 10), rpois(10, 7)))
    ```

3. Use `map()` to fit linear models to the `mtcars` dataset using the formulas stored in this list:
    ```{r, eval = F}
    formulas <- list(
       mpg ~ disp,
       mpg ~ disp + wt,
       mpg ~ I(1 / disp) + wt
    )
    ```

???

1. `map(1:3, ~ runif(2))` evaluates `runif()` with `n = 2` in every iteration since `~` converts to an anonymous function. `map(1:3, runif(2))` evaluates `runif(2)` only once and cannot do mapping because `runif(2)` is not treated as a function. `NULL` is returned in every iteration.

2. Code:
    ```r
    library(ggplot2)
    
    trials_df <- tibble(p_value = map_dbl(trials, "p.value"))
    
    trials_df %>% 
      ggplot(aes(x = p_value, fill = p_value < 0.05)) + 
      geom_histogram(binwidth = .025) +
      ggtitle("Distribution of p-values for random Poisson data.")
    ```

3. Code:
  ```r
  models <- map(formulas, lm, data = mtcars)
  ```

## Case Study: Model Fitting with `purrr`

.smaller[

Tired of `mtcars`? We're too... let's use `cars2018`, a dataset on fuel efficiency of real cars of today from a US Department of Energy instead! 🚗🚗🚗

We will now take a quick look at how `purrr` functions can be used to fit a regression model to subgroups of data, extract estimates and then compare the approach to base R approaches.

**Instructions**

1. Load the `cars2018.csv` dataset and split it by `Drive`, see `?split`

2. Use `purrr` (preferably together with `dplyr`) to

      - fit the model `MPG ~ Cylinders` to each subgroup
      - extract the estimated coefficient of `Cylinders`
    
3. Contrast your `purrr` approach to base R alternatives that rely on `*apply()` and `for()`, respectively

```

**`for()` loop**

```{r}
slopes <- double(length(by_drive))
for (i in seq_along(by_drive)) {
  model <- lm(MPG ~ Cylinders, data = by_drive[[i]])
  slopes[[i]] <- coef(model)[[2]]

## Case Study: Model Fitting with `purrr`

- `purrr` code is most accessible as each line encapsulates a single step and the `purrr` helpers allow us to concisely describe what to do in each step.

- Moving from `purrr` to base R we see that the number functions which iterate decreases while each iteration becomes increasingly complicated:

  - Using `purrr` we iterate 3 times (`map()`, `map()` and `map_dbl()`)

  - The `apply()` approach iterates twice (`lapply()` and `vapply()`)

  - Everything can be done in one `for()` loop

.content-box-white[
**Take-away-message**: functional-style programming using `purrr` allows to decompose the task into simple steps. The code is easier to understand, modify and adapt to other applications.

## Map Variants

.smaller[

In total there are 23 variants of `map()` which are easily understood as variants of the following functions:

- Output same type as input: **`modify()`**

- Iterate over two inputs: **`map2()`**

- Iterate with an index: **`imap()`**

- Return nothing: **`walk()`**

- Iterate over any number of inputs: **`pmap()`**

<br>

|    	                   | List          |	Atomic       | Same type     | Nothing      |
| ---------------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------ |
| One argument	         | `map()`	     | `map_*()`	   | `modify()`    | `walk()`     |
| Two arguments	         | `map2()`	     | `map2_*()`	   | `modify2()`   | `walk2()`    |
| One argument + index	 | `imap()`	     | `imap_*()`	   | `imodify()`	 | `iwalk()`    |
| N arguments	       	   | `pmap()`      | `pmap_*()`	   | `—`	         | `pwalk()`    |

```{r}
df <- data.frame(
  x = 1:3,
  y = 6:4

Note that `modify()` does not modify in-place but creates a copy which must be assigned if changing the input is required.

```{r}
df <- modify(df, ~ .x * 2)
```

## `purrr::pmap()`

      Transmission = function(x) factor(x, labels = c("Automatic", "Manual", "CVT"))
    )
    
    nm <- names(trans)
    mtcars[nm] <- map2(trans, cars2018[nm], function(f, var) f(var))
    ```

3. Compare and contrast the `map2()` approach to this `map()` approach:
    ```{r, eval=F}
    mtcars[nm] <- map(nm, ~ trans[[.x]](cars2018[[.x]]))

???

1. `modify()` is a shortcut for `x[[i]] <- f(x[[i]]); return(x)`. So every row is filled with it's first value.

## `purrr::reduce()`

Having only two main variants, the `reduce` family of functions is much smaller than the `map` family and implements a less commonly needed yet powerful concept:

`reduce()` produces a vector of length 1 from vector input by calling `f` with a pair of values at a time: `reduce(1:4, f)` gives `f(f(f(1, 2), 3), 4)`.

## `purrr::reduce()`

.smaller[

`reduce()` is useful for generalising a binary function (a function with two inputs) to any number of inputs.

.blockquote.exercise[
#### `r desktop` Example: set operations with vectors

Consider the following list of numeric vectors `l`.

```{r}
l <- map(1:4, ~ sample(1:10, 15, replace = T))
str(l)
```

Suppose you want to find values which occur in all vectors in `l`. Note that `intersect()` is binary, i.e. it returns the intersection of elements in two input vectors.

#### `r desktop` Example: set operations with vectors &mdash; ctd.

A base R solution is rather cumbersome even for a small set of vectors.

```{r}
out <- l[[1]]
out <- intersect(out, l[[2]])
out <- intersect(out, l[[3]])
out <- intersect(out, l[[4]])
out
```

We could generalise the above to an arbitrary number of vectors using a loop but such operations are conveniently handled by `reduce()` which is also more efficient.

```{r}
reduce(l, intersect)
reduce(l, union)
```

## `purrr::accumulate()`

.smaller[

`accumulate()` is a variant of `reduce()` which returns the final and all intermediate results.

.blockquote.exercise[
#### `r desktop` Example: cumulative sum

The difference between `reduce()` and `accumulate()` is best understood using a sequence of binary arithmetic operations.

```{r}
x <- 1:3
reduce(x, `+`)
```

vs.

```{r}
x <- 1:3
accumulate(x, `+`)
```

So with `.f` a function for binary intersection we also obtain the 'intermediate' sets.

accumulate(l, intersect)

Function Factories

## Function Factories

.smaller[

A function factory is a function that makes functions.

.blockquote.exercise[
#### `r desktop` Example: function factory

```{r}
nth_root <- function(n) {   # function factory
  function(x) {
    x^(1/n)
  }
}

cube_root <- nth_root(3)    # manufactured function
cube_root(8)
```

]]

---
## Function Factories

.smaller[
The enclosing environment of the manufactured function is an **execution environment** of the function factory.

.blockquote.exercise[
#### `r desktop` Example: function factory &mdash; ctd.

```{r}
rlang::env_print(cube_root)     # inspect enclosing environment
rlang::fn_env(cube_root)$n      # retrieve from enclosing environment
```

]]

???

- Remember that in execution environments are ephemeral in general: they are destroyed if the function has run.

- Here the enclosing environment of `cube_root()` was the execution environment of `nth_root()` &mdash; a mechanism which makes function factories possible.

## Function Factories

Remember lazy evaluation!

.blockquote.exercise[
#### `r desktop` Example: function factory &mdash; ctd.

```{r}
n <- 2
sq <- nth_root(n)
n <- 16
sq(64)             # should evaluate to 8?!
```

]]

???

- `64^(1/16) = 1.29684`

- `x` is lazily evaluated when `sq()` is run, not when `nth_root()` is run. We thus need to force evaluation.

- This is likely to happen rarely but it's a good practice to avoid such a bug by using `force()` in your factories

}

n <- 2
sq <- nth_root(n)
n <- 16
sq(64)             # better :-)
```

]]

???

- To students: why `force(x)` and not just `x`? (check def. of `force()`

- Note on Garbage Collection:
    
    As manufactured functions hold on to the execution environment of the function factory you need to remove large objects manually.
```r
f1 <- function(n) {
  x <- runif(n)
  m <- mean(x)
  rm(x) # use lobstr::obj_size() on a man. function to see difference
  function() m
}
```

## Function Factories &mdash; Stateful Functions

.smaller[
Function factories allow us to create functions with a memory.
.blockquote.exercise[
#### `r desktop` Example: counter

```{r}
new_counter <- function() {
  i <- 0
  function() {
    i <<- i + 1
    i
  }
}
counter_one <- new_counter()
counter_two <- new_counter()

replicate(2, counter_one())
replicate(5, counter_two())
```

]]

???

Should be used with moderation. The S6 system is more suitable if your manufactured functions are to manage multiple variables.

## Case Study: Maximum Likelihood Estimation

Consider the problem of finding the MLE for $\lambda$ when modelling data $\mathbb{x} = (x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n)$ using the Poisson distribution. We have

\begin{align*}
P(\lambda, \mathbb{x}) =& \, \prod_{i=1}^n\frac{\lambda^{x_i}\exp{\lambda}}{x_i!} \Leftrightarrow \log(P(\lambda, \mathbb{x})) = \log(\lambda)\sum_{i=1}^n x_i - n\lambda - \sum_{i=1}^n\log(x_i!).
\end{align*}

The log-likelihood is easily implemented as an R function:

```{r}
lprob_poisson <- function(lambda, x) {
  n <- length(x)
  (log(lambda) * sum(x)) - (n * lambda) - sum(lfactorial(x))
}
```

- Implement a function factory `ll_poisson()` which manufactures a Poisson log-likelihood for a given data vector `x`

- Use `ll_poisson()` to estimate $\lambda$ based on a sample of 100 pseudorandom numbers from $poiss (\lambda = 30)$

## Case Study: Maximum Likelihood Estimation

.smaller[
A general Poisson log-likelihood for data `x` can also be implemented using a function factory.
]

```{r}
ll_poisson <- function(x) {
  # components that depend on x only
  n <- length(x)
  sum_x <- sum(x)
  c <- sum(lfactorial(x))

  # manufactured function
  function(lambda) {
    log(lambda) * sum_x - n * lambda - c
  }
}
```

???

- The advantage of using a function factory here is fairly small, but there are two niceties:

    - We can precompute some values in the factory, saving computation time in each iteration.

    - The two-level design better reflects the mathematical structure of the underlying problem.

- These advantages get bigger in more complex MLE problems, where you have multiple parameters and multiple data vectors.

Let's find the MLE for a Poisson random vector.

```{r, cache=T}
x1 <- rpois(100, 30)
llp <- ll_poisson(x1)

optimise(lprob_poisson, x = x1, c(0, 40), maximum = T)
# better:
optimise(llp, c(0, 40), maximum = T)
```
