## S3 Inheritance &mdash; Exercises

1. Adjust the constructor function `new_prime()` such that it allows for subclasses. Then implement a constructor function `new_fermat()` for objects with subclass `fermat`.

2. What happens if you subset `x` (generated as below) using `[[`?
    ```{r, echo = T}
    x <- prime(c(2L, 3L, 5L))
    ```

3. Implement a `[[` method which preserves the `prime` class.
